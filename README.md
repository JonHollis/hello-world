Updating skillset

This follows your standard "Hello World" tutorial.

I have decent PHP knowledge. I have worked and built templates and full websites using:

WordPress

Joomla

Kentico

Bespoke CMS's

I've nearly 20 years experience developing and working with CMS systems from my first job.  Writing table-less HTML, in a text editor, from day 1.

My greatest skill is rendering near-pixel-perfect frontend websites from provided desktop designs, which I make responsive using the standard mobile-first CSS approach.  Depending on the brief, design or best practices, if none of the former.

My main hobby is boxing and I am a part-time father of 2 kids.
